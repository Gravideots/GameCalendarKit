# Game Calendar Kit Unity3D Asset. 
## In-game time and events management system.

***

Using [GameTimeKit asset](link) you can easily

* Create calendar for your game, set starting year, month, day, and time.
* Manage your timeline. Set how much real seconds contains one in-game second. Put the game on pause, speed up or slow down the flow of time as you need using a simple method call.
* Manage workday. Set start and end time. This is helpful for tycoon like games, and session based games(e.g. This Is The Police, Papers Please, This War of Mine, 60 Seconds).
* Create custom in-game events from Visual Editor with two clicks. 
* Prepare events collection from Visual Editor, or create events in runtime. Don't be afraid to mix both options.
* Use force of C# scripts to expand event class, to get exactly what you need.
